## Project Structure

### Framework

The backend and web version use next.js with [our own framework next vibe](nextvibe.dev) on top. Next vibe's goal is to provide a dev experience like in next.js, but with an additional feature to compile to native using expo. We're using shadcn for web and something similar for react native.
This means compile once debug everywhere, but we'll get pretty far with just the next.js dev server.

### App
A React Native app for all platforms (Web, Windows, Android, iOS, Mac) handling:
- Driver management and scheduling
- Restaurant order processing and POS integration
- Customer ordering experience
